"9062997.RomRas.CarolineMatureEvent.14": "...#$b#It was one of my grim mistake.#$b#Unlike you farmer, who had to rely on my enchantment, her magic seed possessed a natural connection with this valley, unlike any ordinary connection but an innermost link to the valley itself that is deeply rooted within her.",
"9062997.RomRas.CarolineMatureEvent.15": "The connection was far deeper than just simple magic...#$b#With the power of the Witch's spell bestowed upon her, her seed of magic became so potent that it even disturbed the most malevolent and dangerous forces within the valley.",

But the most important thing is, these are not any ordinary sunflowers, they petals are 'crystalized' after some days, and they were beautiful! ^^ Since the first batch of sunflowers has now fully matured, Gunther intended to sow all of them before summer so that he could analyse their entire life cycle. He also said that this might be the most special kind of sunflower that he'd ever seen in his life. I was so proud of us, @. ^^ P.S.: Lewis planned to turn it into a tourist attraction for people to come by.
